Project: # üç∑ Wine Quality Prediction üçª

In this project, I used a dataset from Kaggle containing red wine quality scores. I aimed to predict whether a wine is "good quality" or not, simplifying the scores into two categories. The Random Forest algorithm played a key role in building the prediction model.

Key Points:

Dataset: Used Kaggle's Red Wine Quality dataset with quality scores for wines.
Simplified Target: Converted wine quality scores into "good" or "not good" categories.
Algorithm: Employed the Random Forest algorithm for accurate predictions.
Evaluation: Assessed model performance using metrics like accuracy and precision.
Real-world Relevance: Wine quality prediction has practical implications for enthusiasts and the industry.
Future Scope: Project paves the way for exploring other algorithms and features.
GitHub: Code and documentation are available for reference and collaboration.
In a nutshell, this project showcases how Random Forest can simplify wine quality prediction for both connoisseurs and industry professionals.
