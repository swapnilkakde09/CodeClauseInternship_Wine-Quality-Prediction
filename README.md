# 🍷 Wine Quality Prediction 🍻

## Description

For this project, I used Kaggle’s Red Wine Quality dataset to build various classification models to predict whether a particular red wine is “good quality” or not. Each wine in this dataset is given a “quality” score between 0 and 8. For the purpose of this project, I converted the output to a binary output where each wine is either “good quality” (a score of 7 or higher) or not (a score below 7). Here I have used ``Random Forest Algorithm`` to create my prediction model.
