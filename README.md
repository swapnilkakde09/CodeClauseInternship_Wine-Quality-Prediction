# 🍷 Wine Quality Prediction 🍻

## Description

Utilizing Kaggle's Red Wine Quality dataset, I constructed classification models to determine if a red wine qualifies as "good" (score 7+) or not. Employing Random Forest Algorithm, I converted the multi-score quality into binary output, enhancing prediction accuracy.
